# Customer Segmentation Project

## Overview
This project focuses on customer segmentation using machine learning techniques to identify distinct customer groups based on behavioral and demographic data. The goal is to provide actionable insights that can enhance marketing strategies, customer engagement, and business decision-making.

## Project Contents
- **Jupyter Notebook (`customer_segmentation.ipynb`)**: The entire project, including data preprocessing, exploratory data analysis (EDA), model implementation, and insights, is documented inside the Jupyter notebook. 
- **Dataset (`Mall_Customers.csv`)**: The dataset used for segmentation analysis (if applicable).
- **Requirements (`requirements.txt`)**: A list of dependencies required to run the project.
- **README (`README.md`)**: This file, providing an overview of the project.

## How to Use
1. Clone this repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/your-repo/customer-segmentation.git
   cd customer-segmentation
  
2. Follow the detailed step-by-step documentation inside the notebook to understand the methodology, implementation, and findings.

## Key Features
- **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)**: Visualizing data distributions, identifying trends, and extracting key insights.
- **Data Preprocessing**: Cleaning, handling missing values, feature engineering, and scaling.
- **Segmentation Models**: Implementing clustering techniques such as K-Means, DBSCAN, or Hierarchical Clustering for customer segmentation.
- **Evaluation & Insights**: Interpreting and analyzing customer segments to derive actionable business insights.

## Notes
- The Jupyter Notebook contains all explanations, code snippets, and results in a structured and well-documented manner.
- Ensure all required dependencies are installed before running the notebook to avoid any issues.
